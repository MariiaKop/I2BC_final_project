Nowadays distributed computing has become a standard of modern engineering. The most common task of distributed computing is matrix multiplication. In this setup, the user has two matrices *A* and *B* and wishes to compute their product *AB* with the assistance of *N* servers, without leaking any information about *A* or *B* to any server. We assume that all servers are honest and responsive, but that they are curious, in that any *T* of them may collude to try to deduce information about either *A* or *B*. The user also wants to optimize the download rate *R*. The most recent approach is to use polynomial codes for such a problem. In this project, we will implement the prototype of GASP codes for such a problem.
